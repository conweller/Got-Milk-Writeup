# Got Milk Exploit
Connor Onweller and Sophia Freaney

## Let's see what we got here
Looks like we've got the following files:

```
7got_milk
├── gotmilk
└── libmylib.so
```

Hmm looks like we got a library called `libmylib.so` here, we prolly have to do
something with that. Ehh lets try running the executable anyway.

```
